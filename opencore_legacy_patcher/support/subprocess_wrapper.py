    Validate that OCLP_PRIVILEGED_HELPER is a plausible, untampered helper binary

    symlinks, so without these checks anyone able to replace that path with a symlink
    could have us mark an arbitrary root-owned binary setuid-root - a local privilege
    escalation, using an authorization prompt the user has every reason to approve.

    A helper that has lost its setuid bit is itself a possible sign of tampering, so
    "unexpected permissions" is treated as a reason to look harder, not as routine drift.

    Checks (all must hold):
      - the path is a regular file and NOT a symlink (lstat, so we inspect the link itself)
      - it is owned by root
      - its parent directory is owned by root and is not group- or world-writable

    Deliberately does NOT enforce a code-signature/Team ID check: this fork intentionally
    runs an unsigned helper, so codesign verification would fail by design here. That means
