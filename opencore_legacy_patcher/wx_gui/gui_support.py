    Small floating window embedding the Gemini web app, used by the
    "Ask Gemini" buttons throughout the GUI.

    Deliberately implemented with wx.html2.WebView (wxWidgets' own
    native web view wrapper) rather than the third-party 'pywebview'
    package. pywebview's macOS/Cocoa backend unconditionally calls
    WKNavigationAction.shouldPerformDownload() inside its
    WKNavigationDelegate callback, but that property was only added in
    macOS 11.3 (Big Sur) - see WebKit's WKNavigationAction.h. On older
    hosts (e.g. macOS 10.13 High Sierra, still a supported OCLP host
    OS) the call raises before the callback invokes its
    decisionHandler, which PyObjC then reports on the object's next
    dealloc as:
        "PyObjC: Exception during dealloc of proxy: Completion handler
         passed to -[BrowserDelegate webView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:
         decisionHandler:] was not called"
    wx.html2.WebView never takes that code path, so it works
    consistently across all supported host OS versions.

    The requested `size` is clamped to the current display's usable work
    area (screen minus menu bar/Dock) before showing the WebView. A fixed
    size (e.g. the 500x850 used by the Help menu's "Ask Gemini" button)
    can be taller than the available screen height on a smaller display -
    a VM's virtual display in particular - which otherwise makes the
